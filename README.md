#Implementation of an Algorithm for the Calculation of the Smallest Enclosing Circle and the Voronoi Diagram By Sven Skyum 1991
#### It implements the algorithms included in the publication with the above title efficiently (O(nlogn)) using the Java programming language for the back-end and java-fx for the front-end as well as some additional libraries for reading various types of files. Moreover, we used efficient structures such as red-black balanced binary search tree, HashMap etc. to achieve O(nlogn) complexity in all 4 algorithms implemented (Graham Scan, Smallest Enclosing Circle, Nearest Neighbor Voronoi Diagram, Farthest Neighbor Voronoi Diagram).

#### More specifically, it uses the following
- Eclipse IDE 2022-12
- back-end: Java 17.0.7
- front-end: JavaFX 19
- CSV parsing: opencsv-5.7.1
- Excel parsing: poi-5.2.3
- and more...
