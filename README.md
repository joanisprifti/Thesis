# Implementation of an Algorithm for the Calculation of the Smallest Enclosing Circle and the Voronoi Diagram By Sven Skyum 1991
#### Implementation of an Algorithm for the Calculation of the Smallest Enclosing Circle and the Voronoi Diagram in O(nlogn) complexity using efficient structures such as Red-Black balanced binary search tree, HashMap etc. The application has been developed in Java, JavaFX, css primarily following MVC and Singleton pattern. It offers a beautiful and easy to use graphical interface understandable by any user. It is able to run on any computer with Windows.

#### More specifically, it uses the following
- Eclipse IDE 2022-12
- back-end: Java 17.0.7
- front-end: JavaFX 19
- CSV parsing: opencsv-5.7.1
- Excel parsing: poi-5.2.3
- and more...
